# payment-orchestration

[![CI](https://github.com/amritshukla001/payment-orchestration/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/amritshukla001/payment-orchestration/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A backend system-design playground — a portfolio project built to
deliberately exercise as broad a range of real HLD and LLD concepts as
possible, not to showcase one pattern. A payments-processing pipeline is
the vehicle here, not the point: distributed-transaction patterns,
event-driven architecture, and classic OOP design patterns are what it's
actually about, applied to original, non-proprietary domain logic.

Structurally, a payment moves through a chain of independent services —
fraud check, funds authorization, ledger posting, settlement,
notification — coordinated by a saga orchestrator. That's one pattern
among several in play (see [Concepts & patterns demonstrated](#concepts--patterns-demonstrated)
below) rather than the whole story. If any step fails, previously
completed steps are unwound via compensating actions instead of leaving
the system in a half-done state.

## Architecture

```
Client → Payment API (+ outbox) → Kafka: payment.events ⇄ Notification Service
                                          │                  (passive observer,
                                   Saga Orchestrator          no command needed)
                                          ⇄ Kafka: payment.commands
                                          │           │            │           │
                          ┌───────────────┼───────────┴───┬────────┴───┬───────┘
                          ▼               ▼                ▼           ▼
                    Fraud Service   Funds Auth        Ledger        Settlement
                                                       Service        Service
                                                                        │
                                    (happy path loops back with POST_FINAL_LEDGER)
```

**Compensation path** (when settlement declines after funds were already
authorized — see below): `SETTLEMENT_DECLINED → COMPENSATING → REVERSE_LEDGER
→ LEDGER_REVERSED → RELEASE_FUNDS → FUNDS_RELEASED → COMPENSATED`, undoing
steps in the reverse order they were applied.

- **payment-api** — REST intake. Validates a request, persists it, and
  publishes an event via the transactional outbox pattern (write + outbox
  row in one DB transaction, published by a separate poller) — avoids the
  dual-write problem between the database and Kafka.
- **saga-orchestrator** — owns the payment's state machine. Consumes domain
  events on `payment.events`, decides the next step, and issues commands on
  `payment.commands`. Keeps the whole lifecycle in one place instead of
  scattering it across every service's event handlers.
- **fraud-service** — consumes `CHECK_FRAUD` commands, evaluates independent
  rule strategies (`FraudRule` implementations, Strategy pattern), publishes
  the verdict back onto `payment.events`.
- **funds-auth-service** — a mock bank. Lazily provisions accounts on first
  sight, reserves/releases funds with optimistic locking. Its `RELEASE_FUNDS`
  handler credits the account back and publishes `FUNDS_RELEASED` — the
  final step of compensation.
- **ledger-service** — append-only double-entry ledger. Posts the HOLD leg
  (debit payer, credit a fixed suspense account) when funds are authorized,
  the FINAL leg (debit suspense, credit payee) once settlement confirms
  capture, or a REVERSAL leg (debit suspense, credit payer — the exact
  inverse of HOLD) if settlement declines instead. Nothing here is ever
  updated — a correction is always a new offsetting entry, never a
  mutation of history.
- **settlement-service** — confirms capture: records its own `settlements`
  row (distinct from the ledger's postings) and publishes `PAYMENT_SETTLED`.
  The orchestrator marks the payment `SETTLED` immediately on that event —
  terminal from the payer/payee's perspective — then separately tells
  ledger-service to post the FINAL leg as a bookkeeping step that follows
  behind rather than gates the terminal state, mirroring how real
  settlement and ledger close can lag each other slightly. Amounts between
  $9,000–$10,000 get declined instead (`SettlementRiskCheck`) — a
  realistic payments scenario where the issuer clears authorization but
  declines at capture — which is the only point in this saga where
  compensation has anything real to undo.
- **notification-service** — architecturally the odd one out: it subscribes
  directly to `payment.events` for `PAYMENT_SETTLED`/`PAYMENT_FAILED`/
  `PAYMENT_COMPENSATED` rather than reacting to an orchestrator-issued
  command, since nothing depends on a notification succeeding. Notifies
  both payer and payee on success; payer only on failure or compensation.
  Its Kafka config is consumer-only — no producer, because it never
  publishes anything back.
- **common** — shared event/command contracts (`EventEnvelope`, `PaymentState`,
  event and command records) used by every service.

Every event carries a stable `eventId` (`EventEnvelope`), and every consumer
checks its own `processed_events` table before acting — Kafka only guarantees
at-least-once delivery, so idempotent processing is what makes redelivery
safe rather than a source of duplicate work.

Each service owns its own Postgres database (`payflow`, `orchestrator`,
`fraud`, `fundsauth`, `ledger`, `settlement`, `notification`), even though
they currently share one container for local-dev convenience — mirrors
"database per service" without needing a separate Postgres instance per
service.

## Compensation

Every prior phase's `FAILED` path happened *before* anything was reserved —
fraud rejects before funds are touched, insufficient funds means nothing
was ever reserved. There was nothing to compensate, which would have made
the Saga pattern's actual reason for existing untested. So settlement-service
was given a real decline scenario (`SettlementRiskCheck`, $9,000–$10,000) —
the issuer clears authorization but declines at capture, a genuine payments
scenario — creating the one point in this saga where compensation has
something real to undo.

The sequence undoes the saga's steps in **reverse order** of how they were
originally applied:

1. `SETTLEMENT_DECLINED` → orchestrator sets state to `COMPENSATING`,
   issues `REVERSE_LEDGER`.
2. ledger-service posts a REVERSAL entry (debit suspense, credit payer —
   the exact inverse of the original HOLD) → publishes `LEDGER_REVERSED`.
3. Orchestrator issues `RELEASE_FUNDS` (state stays `COMPENSATING` — this
   is the second of two compensating actions, not the last step yet).
4. funds-auth-service credits the payer's account back → publishes
   `FUNDS_RELEASED`.
5. Orchestrator sets state to `COMPENSATED` (terminal), publishes
   `PAYMENT_COMPENSATED` → notification-service notifies the payer.

Verified end-to-end: a $9,500 payment reaches `COMPENSATED` with the
ledger's HOLD and REVERSAL entries exactly offsetting, the payer's account
balance restored to its exact starting value, the funds reservation marked
`RELEASED`, and no `settlements` row ever created.

## Concepts & patterns demonstrated

**Distributed systems / HLD**
- **Saga (orchestration, not choreography)** — a central orchestrator owns
  the state machine rather than scattering the payment lifecycle across
  every service's event handlers; see the tradeoff this was chosen over.
  Includes real **compensating transactions** (see [Compensation](#compensation)
  above), not just the happy path — the actual reason the pattern exists.
- **Transactional Outbox** — write + outbox row in one DB transaction,
  published by a separate poller, avoiding the dual-write problem between
  a database and Kafka.
- **Idempotent Consumer** — every consumer checks its own `processed_events`
  table before acting, since Kafka only guarantees at-least-once delivery.
- **Database per service** — seven services, seven separate Postgres
  databases, no shared schema.
- **Optimistic locking** — `@Version` on `Payment`, `PaymentSagaState`, and
  `Account` guards concurrent writers without pessimistic locks.
- **Schema evolution via versioned migrations** — a real schema change
  (`payment_saga_state` gaining `payee_account`) shipped as a new Flyway
  `V2` migration, never editing the applied `V1`.
- **Consistency tradeoffs** — strong (ACID) consistency within each
  service's own database, eventual consistency across the saga as a whole.

**Classic OOP / LLD (Gang of Four)**
- **Strategy** — fraud-service's `FraudRule` interface, with
  `HighValueThresholdRule` and `PositiveAmountRule` as independent
  `@Component` beans Spring autowires into the engine's rule list.
- **Mediator** — the saga orchestrator: fraud-service and funds-auth-service
  never call each other directly, only the orchestrator.
- **Command** — `CheckFraudCommand`, `AuthorizeFundsCommand`, etc. are
  requests encapsulated as objects; `ReleaseFundsCommand`/`ReverseLedgerCommand`
  are the literal *undo* counterparts to `AuthorizeFundsCommand`/`PostLedgerCommand`,
  actually issued now that compensation is wired up, not just defined ahead of time.
- **Factory Method** — static factories on result types (`Verdict.approve()` /
  `.reject()`), and Spring's `ConsumerFactory`/`ProducerFactory` beans.
- **Repository** — every `JpaRepository` interface.
- **Singleton** — every Spring-managed `@Component`/`@Service` bean.
- **Observer** — notification-service subscribes to `payment.events` as a
  passive observer of terminal outcomes, distinct from every other
  service's Command-style "react to what the orchestrator explicitly told
  you to do." Earlier phases of this project noted Kafka pub/sub is
  *architecturally* Observer-shaped but nothing here hand-rolled it — this
  is the point where that stopped being true.

Not every pattern fits everywhere, and forcing one in where it doesn't
belong would defeat the point — Decorator and Template Method are
deliberately not used here; nothing in this codebase needed them.

## Observability

Every service exposes Prometheus-formatted metrics at `/actuator/prometheus`
(added to the existing `health,info` exposure) and exports distributed
traces via OpenTelemetry to a local Zipkin collector — both come mostly for
free from Micrometer/Spring Boot Actuator, already a dependency of every
service, plus `micrometer-registry-prometheus` and
`micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel` + `opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin` added on
top of it.

- **Metrics** — JVM, HTTP request, and Hikari connection-pool metrics are
  auto-instrumented by Actuator with no code changes. `docker compose`
  brings up a `prometheus` container (`docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml`)
  that scrapes all seven services on their host ports via
  `host.docker.internal`, since services run on the host via
  `mvn spring-boot:run` rather than inside the compose network. Browse
  metrics/targets at http://localhost:9090.
- **Distributed tracing** — 100% sampling (`management.tracing.sampling.probability:
  1.0` — a demo default, not a production one) with spans exported to a
  `zipkin` container at http://localhost:9411. Inbound HTTP requests get a
  span automatically; the more interesting piece is **Kafka**, since every
  hop between saga steps is an async publish/consume rather than a direct
  call. Each service's `KafkaConfig` explicitly enables Micrometer
  Observation (`setObservationEnabled(true)`) on both its listener container
  and its `KafkaTemplate`, which is what lets a single trace ID follow a
  payment across `payment-api → saga-orchestrator → fraud-service →
  funds-auth-service → ledger-service → settlement-service` and back,
  stitched together over Kafka rather than lost at each broker hop.
- The `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint sits behind the same `/actuator`
  exemption in `ApiKeyAuthFilter` that already covers `/actuator/health` —
  scraping is unauthenticated by design, matching how Prometheus itself is
  normally trusted at the network boundary rather than the app layer.

## Resilience

Every consumer service's `@KafkaListener` method now retries transient
failures in-process, with exponential backoff, before falling back to
today's ultimate safety net: log the failure, don't ack, let Kafka
redeliver. Before this, any failure — transient or not — was caught, logged,
and silently discarded, which meant the `@Transactional` method actually
**committed** whatever partial state existed at the point of failure instead
of rolling it back, and the only retry mechanism was Kafka's own immediate,
unbounded, zero-backoff redelivery.

`@Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class)` and Resilience4j's
`@Retry(name = "kafka-consumer", fallbackMethod = "...")` sit on the same
listener method (`resilience4j.retry.instances.kafka-consumer` in each
service's `application.yml`: 3 attempts, 200ms initial wait, ×2 exponential
backoff). That combination is safe — not incidental — because Resilience4j's
`RetryAspect` defaults to a lower `@Order` than Spring's transaction advice
(`LOWEST_PRECEDENCE - 4` vs. `LOWEST_PRECEDENCE`), so **Retry always wraps
outside Transactional**: every retry attempt gets a fresh transaction and a
clean persistence context, and a failed attempt's writes are rolled back
before the next one starts, rather than accumulating in one open
transaction. This was verified empirically (a throwaway Spring Boot + H2 app
using the exact same annotation combination) before being applied here: a
method that fails once then succeeds ends with exactly one committed row,
not two; a method that always fails hits exactly `max-attempts` tries with
the configured backoff between them, then the fallback runs — without the
exception ever propagating back to the `@KafkaListener` container, so `ack`
is simply never reached, identical in effect to the old catch block, just
retried with backoff first.

**Scope boundary**: this only adds backoff to the in-process retry that
happens *before* Kafka redelivery, not a circuit breaker and not dead-letter
handling. A genuinely poisoned message (one that will never succeed) still
loops forever at the outer Kafka-redelivery layer once Resilience4j's bounded
retries are exhausted each time — that's a separate, not-yet-built concern.

## Dashboard

`dashboard/` is a small React + AG Grid ops console — a live grid of every
payment and its current saga state, with a per-payment detail drawer showing
ledger postings and notifications. It's deliberately *not* a new backend
service: it's a thin client polling three read-only REST APIs added to
existing services —

- `GET /api/sagas` (saga-orchestrator, port 8082) — the grid itself.
  This is the only service whose view of a payment reflects its *current*
  state; `payment-api`'s own `payments` row is stamped `INITIATED` at
  creation and never updated again, since it has no Kafka consumer of its
  own.
- `GET /api/ledger/{paymentId}` (ledger-service, port 8085) — the double-entry
  postings shown in the drawer.
- `GET /api/notifications/{paymentId}` (notification-service, port 8087) —
  the notifications shown in the drawer.

There's no API gateway in front of these yet (still on the roadmap below),
so the frontend calls each service's port directly; each controller has
`@CrossOrigin` opened for the Vite dev server's origin. See
`dashboard/README.md` for how to run it.

## Security

Every REST endpoint across the four services that expose one — `payment-api`,
`saga-orchestrator`, `ledger-service`, `notification-service` — requires an
`X-API-Key` header, checked by a shared `ApiKeyAuthFilter` in `common` that
each service registers explicitly via its own `FilterRegistrationBean`
(component scanning never crosses from `common` into a service's own base
package, so this can't just be a `@Component` picked up automatically). The
key is a single configured value (`payflow.security.api-key`, overridable via
the `PAYFLOW_API_KEY` env var, defaulting to `local-dev-api-key-change-me`
for local dev) — deliberately simple, since the point is demonstrating the
auth boundary itself, not building a credential-management system.
`/actuator/**` is explicitly exempted so health checks keep working
unauthenticated. `fraud-service`, `funds-auth-service`, and
`settlement-service` have no custom REST endpoints (Kafka-only), so there's
nothing to gate on them beyond actuator.

## Status

**Built — all 7 core services, including real compensation, plus a live dashboard:**
`payment-api`, `saga-orchestrator`, `fraud-service`, `funds-auth-service`,
`ledger-service`, `settlement-service`, `notification-service`. The full
happy path works end to end — intake through fraud approval, funds
authorization, ledger HOLD posting, settlement capture, a final
double-entry ledger posting, and notifications to both parties, all the
way to `SETTLED`. Both early-failure branches (fraud threshold,
insufficient funds) work too. And the saga's actual reason for existing —
**compensating transactions** — is wired up and verified: a settlement
decline after funds were already authorized correctly reverses the ledger
HOLD, releases the reservation, and restores the payer's balance to its
exact starting value, ending in `COMPENSATED`. All verified against real
Kafka and Postgres, not just compiled. On top of that, the
[Dashboard](#dashboard) above gives a live, browsable view over all of it,
every REST endpoint is gated behind [API-key auth](#security),
[Observability](#observability) gives Prometheus metrics and Kafka-spanning
distributed traces across the whole saga, every Kafka listener now retries
transient failures with exponential backoff before falling back to Kafka
redelivery (see [Resilience](#resilience)), and [Load testing](#load-testing)
gives k6 scripts to turn the design doc's capacity estimate into a measured
number.

**Also on the roadmap** — the difference between a demo and something that
reads as production-grade:
- **API documentation** — OpenAPI/Swagger on payment-api
- **Containerization** — a Dockerfile per service + a compose file that builds from source, so running this doesn't require a local Java/Maven install
- **Architecture Decision Records** — short docs on why Kafka over Pulsar, why orchestration over choreography
- **Schema evolution discipline** — every future schema change ships as a new Flyway migration, never editing one already applied

## Testing

Tests are written alongside each service as it's built, not deferred to the
end — every phase since `fraud-service` has shipped with its own tests.

- **Unit tests** (JUnit 5 + Mockito) for pure logic and mockable
  collaborators: fraud-service's `FraudRule` strategies and rule engine,
  funds-auth-service's `MockBankLedger` and command listener (both
  authorize and release paths), ledger-service's `DoubleEntryLedger` (HOLD,
  FINAL, and REVERSAL legs), settlement-service's `SettleCommandListener`
  and `SettlementRiskCheck`, notification-service's `PaymentOutcomeListener`
  (both-parties-on-success, payer-only-on-failure-or-compensation), and —
  the most important one — saga-orchestrator's `PaymentEventListener`,
  covering every state transition including the full compensation sequence
  (`SETTLEMENT_DECLINED → COMPENSATING → LEDGER_REVERSED → COMPENSATING →
  FUNDS_RELEASED → COMPENSATED`, chained through one test to prove it lands
  on `COMPENSATED` rather than getting stuck), both early-failure branches,
  idempotent redelivery, and unknown-payment handling. That last suite is
  the **regression pack** for the saga: every scenario in it mirrors
  something that was previously verified by hand with curl + psql, now
  automated so a future change can't silently break it without CI catching it.
  saga-orchestrator, settlement-service, notification-service, and
  funds-auth-service's listener tests each also cover the resilience
  refactor: a collaborator failure now propagates out of the listener
  method instead of being silently swallowed, with `ack` never called —
  the plain-Mockito unit tests don't exercise Resilience4j's AOP-driven
  retry/backoff itself (that needs a real Spring proxy), but they do prove
  the try/catch removal didn't regress the "don't ack on failure" contract.
- **Integration test** (Testcontainers — real Postgres + real Kafka, not
  mocks) for payment-api: posts a real payment over HTTP, confirms it's
  persisted, confirms the outbox actually published to a live Kafka topic,
  confirms the `Idempotency-Key` retry path returns the same payment instead
  of creating a duplicate, confirms a request with no `X-API-Key` is
  rejected with `401`, and confirms `/actuator/prometheus` is reachable and
  actually emits metrics (not just mapped).
- `common`'s `ApiKeyAuthFilter` has its own unit test covering the correct
  key, a missing key, a wrong key, and an exempt path (`/actuator/**`) — the
  one piece of logic shared identically across all four gated services.

Run everything: `mvn test` from the repo root (requires Docker for the
Testcontainers-based payment-api test — this needs a Docker Engine version
Testcontainers is tested against; a very new Docker Desktop can trip a
known compatibility issue between Testcontainers and its bundled
docker-java client, in which case CI is the source of truth for that one
test rather than your local machine).

## Load testing

`load-test/` has two k6 scripts against `payment-api`, turning the [design
doc](RESUME.md)'s capacity estimate — 20 payments/sec average, 100/sec peak
— into an actual measured number rather than a back-of-envelope guess:

- **`payments-throughput-test.js`** — hits `POST /payments` at exactly
  those two documented rates back to back, reporting `http_req_duration`
  percentiles and gating on error rate (`< 1%`, since there's no stated
  latency SLA to gate on instead).
- **`saga-completion-latency-test.js`** — measures the other half of the
  picture: not how fast the API *accepts* a payment (that's instant, by
  the outbox design), but how long the *whole saga* takes to actually
  reach `SETTLED`/`FAILED`/`COMPENSATED`, by polling after each POST.

Requires `k6` (`brew install k6`) and the full stack running locally. See
`load-test/README.md` for exact commands and how to override the target
host/API key. Manual/local only — not wired into CI, since load tests are
slow and need the full docker-compose stack up, unlike the unit/integration
suite `mvn verify` already runs on every push.

## Running it locally

Requires Docker Desktop and Java 21 + Maven.

```bash
# 1. Start infra (Postgres, Kafka, Kafka UI)
docker compose up -d

# 2. Build everything
mvn -DskipTests install

# 3. Start each service (separate terminals)
cd payment-api && mvn spring-boot:run          # :8080
cd saga-orchestrator && mvn spring-boot:run    # :8082
cd fraud-service && mvn spring-boot:run        # :8083
cd funds-auth-service && mvn spring-boot:run   # :8084
cd ledger-service && mvn spring-boot:run       # :8085
cd settlement-service && mvn spring-boot:run   # :8086
cd notification-service && mvn spring-boot:run # :8087

# 4. (optional) Start the dashboard
cd dashboard && npm install && npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
```

Kafka UI is at http://localhost:8081 for browsing topics/messages directly.
Prometheus is at http://localhost:9090 (metrics/targets), Zipkin is at
http://localhost:9411 (traces) — see [Observability](#observability).

### Try it

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: demo-1" \
  -H "X-API-Key: local-dev-api-key-change-me" \
  -d '{"payerAccount":"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111","payeeAccount":"22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222","amountCents":2500,"currency":"USD"}'
```

A normal amount like the above reaches `SETTLED` within a couple of
seconds. Amounts over $10,000 (`amountCents > 1000000`) get rejected by the
fraud rule instead — try it to see the saga end in `FAILED`.

To see actual **compensation**, send an amount between $9,000–$10,000
(clears fraud and funds authorization, then gets declined at settlement):

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: demo-compensation-1" \
  -H "X-API-Key: local-dev-api-key-change-me" \
  -d '{"payerAccount":"33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333","payeeAccount":"44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444","amountCents":950000,"currency":"USD"}'
```

That reaches `COMPENSATED` — check the ledger to see the HOLD and REVERSAL
entries exactly offsetting (below), and the account balance restored:

```bash
docker exec payflow-postgres psql -U payflow -d fundsauth \
  -c "SELECT account_id, balance_cents FROM accounts WHERE account_id = '33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333';"
```

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: local-dev-api-key-change-me" http://localhost:8080/payments/<id>
curl -H "X-API-Key: local-dev-api-key-change-me" http://localhost:8080/payments/<id>/timeline
```

Check saga progress directly (or just watch it live in the
[dashboard](#dashboard) instead):

```bash
docker exec payflow-postgres psql -U payflow -d orchestrator \
  -c "SELECT payment_id, state FROM payment_saga_state;"
```

Check both ledger legs (HOLD then FINAL):

```bash
docker exec payflow-postgres psql -U payflow -d ledger \
  -c "SELECT payment_id, debit_account, credit_account, amount_cents, posting_type FROM ledger_entries ORDER BY posted_at;"
```

Check the settlement capture record:

```bash
docker exec payflow-postgres psql -U payflow -d settlement \
  -c "SELECT payment_id, amount_cents, captured_at FROM settlements;"
```

Check who got notified (both payer and payee on success; payer only on a
`FAILED` payment):

```bash
docker exec payflow-postgres psql -U payflow -d notification \
  -c "SELECT payment_id, recipient, outcome, message FROM notifications;"
```
